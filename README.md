# README-Generator

## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from user input.

## User Story
AS A Developer when creating an open source project on GitHub.

I WANT to have a high-quality README.md for the app. This should include the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 

SO THAT I CAN quickly and easily create a README.md file by using a command-line application to generate one. 

## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

npm install

## Usage
The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js

The user will then follow the input prompts and once completed a README.md file will be generated using the input content.
